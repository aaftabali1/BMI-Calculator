# BMI Calculator (React Native)

### Description:

The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a mobile application built using React Native that allows users to calculate their BMI based on their height and weight. BMI is a widely used metric to assess an individual's body weight and determine if they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

This project is implemented using React Native, a popular JavaScript framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. It leverages the power of React Native's UI components and native device capabilities to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience on both iOS and Android platforms.

The BMI Calculator app features a user-friendly interface where users can input their height and weight, and the BMI is calculated instantly based on the provided values. The calculated BMI is then displayed along with a corresponding BMI category, helping users understand the interpretation of their BMI result. The app also includes input validation to ensure that height and weight values are entered correctly, providing accurate and reliable results.

### Key features of the BMI Calculator project include:

- Cross-platform mobile app developed using React Native, making it accessible on both iOS and Android devices.
- Input validation to ensure accurate and reliable BMI calculation.
- BMI calculation based on the provided height and weight values, following the standard BMI formula.
- Display of the calculated BMI value and corresponding BMI category (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).
- Intuitive user interface for a smooth and engaging user experience.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- This BMI Calculator project is a great learning resource for developers who want to explore mobile app development with React Native. It can be used as a starting point for building health and fitness-related apps, or customized to add additional features such as personalized user profiles, data tracking, and progress tracking.
